# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
This is my first Machine Learning project based on the Kaggle competition 
"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster".

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic 
shipwreck using basic machine learning techniques.
## Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival based on 
features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.
## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- Files used: train.csv, test.csv
- Features include: Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, SibSp, Parch, Embarked
## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- ## Approach
1. Data exploration and understanding
2. Handling missing values
3. Feature encoding and preprocessing
4. Model training using machine learning algorithms
5. Model evaluation
##Models Used
-Random Forest
## Results
The model was able to predict passenger survival with reasonable accuracy.
This project helped me understand the complete machine learning workflow 
from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
